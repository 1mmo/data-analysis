# Data Analysis Handbook ðŸ“š

Project for storing examples of work from the field of data analysis.

In addition to the tasks solved, the project will cover several topics necessary for the study of data, such as:
1. Data visualization 
2. Linear algebra
3. Statistics
4. Probability
5. Gradient Descent
6. Working with data
7. Machine learning

When studying mathematics, I will try not only to implement the code, but also to give formulas by which the system should work. <br>
My task is to understand the meaning of the topic and translate this idea into python, so that I can use it in real projects in the future.

# User's Manual ðŸ¥·
If you want to look at solved problems, you should go to the "solved problems" directory.<br>
If you want to use the reference book, then you should go to the directory "learning data analysis"

All projects are written on Jupyter Notebook, so you can easily see what was done in the file.
